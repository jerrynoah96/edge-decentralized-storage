                    <p>To achieve scalability, Mirax has built-in sharding support: Mirax blockchains can break and merge automatically to handle changes in load. This means that new blocks are still created easily, and the lack of long queues aids in keeping transaction costs down, even though some of the platform's services become very popular.</p>
